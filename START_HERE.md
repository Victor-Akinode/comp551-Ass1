In order to explore the data, perform all preprocessing, implement the linear regression model, perform evaluations, and more, simply run the notebook in the root directory titled COMP551_Assignment1.ipynb.

In order to view the behind the scenes of the model, please inspect linear_regression.py.
All the preprocessing tools including the OutlierHandler and ArrayScaler can be found in data_parser.py.
The methods to introduce selected engineered features lie in feature_engineering.py.
Finally, the permutation importance tester is stored in feature_importance.py.

All of the above modules are used in the end-to-end pipeline found in the main notebook, but their implementation details are not necessarily revealed.
